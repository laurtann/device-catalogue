# Device Catalogue Submission

Welcome to the Device Catalogue!

Device Catalogue is a React app that allows users to browse a selection of Apple watches and iPhones. This project is built with React client-side, Node and Express on the backend along with Jest for unit testing.

This project was created as a developer challenge for TELUS Digital.

### Challenges
* Configuring import syntax for images with WebPack.
* Images also proved to be a setback for Jest testing. After consulting the docs, I tried several attempts to add a suitable moduleNameMapper in jest config along with a mockFile, but wasn't successful this time. I was able to use a work-around by creating a 'mock' Mock in the components where an image was imported for the purposes of testing (not an ideal solution).

### Wins
* I had fun! I found TDS components quite intuitive to use and well documented. I especially appreciated FlexGrid for layouts.
* While I have experience with testing, this project is my first with Jest. I enjoyed reading through the docs and writing a few tests (despite the image issue above) and I will certainly reach for it on future projects.


### Features I would have liked to add
1. More robust testing, including:
* Testing for error handling (ie 404 pages)
* Accessibility tests (tab order, touch target size, alt-text, color contrast)

2. Additional design considerations for responsiveness across devices, including:
* Media queries for text and images

3. Device search and sort functionality

4. More robust internal navigation


The following libraries and resources were used for this project:
* [TDS Components](https://tds.telus.com/components/) for UI components & CSS
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for client-side data fetching
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for component unit testing

# Device Catalogue

A customer would like to browse all the Apple devices available for purchase. Create an application with a component that reads and displays devices from the local restful API on port `8081`.
The API has two routes `/watches` which returns a list of watches and `/iphones` which returns a list of iPhones.

## Application Requirements

* Create a `/watches` route that displays a grid of watch device cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Create a `/iphones` route that displays a grid of iPhone device cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Each route represents a page in the application. Each page should have a heading indicating the type of device listed on the page and a grid showing all the devices in that category.
* An index page with a list of all pages (i.e. A watch page and phone page).
* Unit tests for your work where it makes sense. At Telus Digital we pride ourselves on having applications with great test coverage. Please be prepared to talk about your testing choices.
* [TDS](https://tds.telus.com/components/index.html) components **MUST** be used. List of useful [components](#useful-tds-components).

Apple Watch and iPhone assets are available in the [public directory](/public/images)

## Submission Requirements

* Fork this repository to your personal Github account
* Submit your solution as a Pull Request against the main branch of your forked repository

## The anatomy of the device API response

The mock API replies with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Apple Watch Series 6",
      "brand": "Apple",
      "price": 1399
    }
  ]
}
```

## Local development

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the local API server on port 8081 along with a client side user interface on port 8080.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Running the tests

```sh
npm run unit
```

## Reference Device Card

All device cards should look as close as possible to the following device card:

Note: all device cards should simply showcase the name of the device, the brand and price with the following copy:

## Reference Device Grid

The device grid should look as close as possible to the following device grid but exact spacing isn't required:
